DESCRIPTION OF CONTENTS:

Chaos in Physics.pdf ------------- This is the powerpoint to be presented in class

writeup.pdf ---------------------- This is the 3pg writeup

pendulum.c ----------------------- This is the .c file of the pendulum, contains the simulation of both single and double pendulum

pendulum.gpl --------------------- This is the macro for the .c pendulum file; need to run this to get data

spendulum.png and spendulum2.png - These are two different initial value single pendulums to show consistency

dpendulum.png and dpendulum2.png - These are two different initial value double pendulums to show chaos

test.gpl and animate1.gpl -------- These two macros are used to make the gif

dpendulum.gif -------------------- Gif movie of the double pendulum made in gnuplot

lorenz.c ------------------------- The lorenz attractor in c programing; need to run this to get data

lorenz.gpl ----------------------- The macro used to get .png files from lorenz data

lorenz.png and lorenz1.png ------- Two different attractors with slightly different initial conditions to show chaos
